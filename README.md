# npmw
NPM Wrapper allowing to use a specific Node + NPM version per project

## Usage
Add it to your project root (aka. next to your package.json), edit the version in the `npmw` script to whatever version you whish to use, then give the owner (you?) of the script execute permissions on it `chmod +x npmw`. Then use it as you would use `npm` but instead write `./npmw`.

## Support
Currently only __Linux__ has been tested.
